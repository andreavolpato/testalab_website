We introduce a novel specimen-adaptive concept of recording super resolution fluorescent images as a step toward a fully automated intelligent microscopy platform.
We applied the concept to RESOLFT optical nanoscopy to perform nanoscale imaging of living cells/tissues/organisms faster and with lower doses of light than previous implementation.  
The automated specimen-adaptation is based on the use of a field-programmable-gate-array- (FPGA-)based data-acquisition-card, which enables to apply a rapid feedback loop between illumination, detection and beam scanning. The rapid communications within these modules allows super resolution imaging only in the part of the field of view containing structures without wasting time and energy in dark pixels.
Furthermore, the FPGA allows to classify the signal emitted by the reversible switchable fluorescent proteins during the entire RESOLFT cycle, which provides multiple images of the same structure with increasing spatial resolution â€“ from confocal to RESOLFT - in a single shot. 
The information content of these images can be re-assigned and combined in the smart RESOLFT<sup>++</sup> image to increase the image contrast through a custom made multi deconvolution algorithm.
