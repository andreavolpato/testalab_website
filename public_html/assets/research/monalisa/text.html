Observing the interplay of organelles and macromolecular complexes inside living cells and tissues calls for the continuous development of minimally invasive optical systems performing at high spatio-temporal resolution. However, the current approaches to fluorescence nanoscopy, even if powerful, are often limited by high doses of light, low contrast, small fields of view or slow recording times. The first limitation can be overcome using Reversible Saturable OpticaL Fluorescent Transition (RESOLFT) approaches, where the coordinate targeted fluorescence ONâ€“OFF switching of reversibly switchable fluorescent protein (rsFPs) requires low light dose (W-kW/cm<sup>2</sup>) to obtain sub-100 nm spatial scale. To tackle the other limitations, we developed Molecular Nanoscale Live Imaging with Sectioning Ability (MoNaLISA). The microscope features extended light patterns with optimized shape and periodicity to switch ON, OFF and readout the fluorescence of rsFPs. The OFF-switch illumination is composed of two orthogonal interference patterns which result in periodic vertical and horizontal lines in the image plane. The ON-switch and readout are confined in multispot arrays with larger periodicity in order to maximize the photon collection and minimize switching fatigue and detection cross-talk. This configuration allows to bring optical section in a highly parallelized architecture, giving to the technique the flexibility to visualize structures in the entire cell. The periodic architecture directly translates into speed, releasing the bond between acquisition speed and field of view, and reaching recording of 0.3-1.3Hz with an extended field of view (50x50 &mu;m<sup>2</sup>). Furthermore, the fragmentation of the ON-switching in multi-foci leads to a spatially confined protein population that minimize unwanted cycling and photobleaching in areas not directly recorded. As a result, the structure of interest can be visualized for many time points (40-50 frames).

We have demonstrated that MoNaLISA enables 4D imaging  at high spatio-temporal resolution and minimal doses of light in several biological systems, from cell to tissues. The examples reported in the figure show actin cytoskeleton structure and dynamics both in adherent cells and in whole embryonic stem cells as they rearrange over time. The speed of the technique can also follow the fine changes in mitochondria morphology during fusion and fission in several sequential volumetric recordings.
