We have developed an open-source platform for the control of light-microscopy setups, especially suitable for targeted-switching light microscopy. The software solution helps microscope builders, users, and developers, push forward their research by providing a robust and adaptable alternative for microscope alignment and control, image reconstruction and analysis using Napari image viewer, and microscope automation using scripting in Python, which we embedded in ImSwitch.
ImSwitch successfully handles multicolor imaging in super-resolution microscopy, both in point-scanning and camera-based setups.
